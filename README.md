# Twitter Sentiment Analysis Dataset 

Analyze and visualize sentiment patterns in social media data to understand public opinion and attitudes towards specific topics or brands.

# The Dataset
The “Twitter Sentiment Analysis” dataset is a collection of approximately 74,000 tweets, the entity or company(Brand) to which they are referring, and an assigned sentiment. With this dataset, we can attempt to analyze and visualize pattern of tweets by the sentiment towards the given brand or company.
                                                                                   As Tweet(text) contains a lot of information, which is easy for us to extract as humans. However, for a computer, it’s a lot more difficult, because of the huge knowledge base and context required to understand natural language. Understanding this natural language can come with huge benefits, especially in sentiment analysis. For example, a company may want to scrape social media to see the public opinion on their product, to know if improvements or PR changes are needed
